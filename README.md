## üìö Educational Content

### Why Password Strength Matters

Weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked, leading to data breaches and identity theft. By using strong passwords (mix of characters, avoiding dictionary words, enabling two-factor authentication), you greatly reduce your security risks.

### Impacts of Using Weak Passwords

- Increased risk of unauthorized account access
- Potential for identity theft and financial loss
- Exposure of sensitive personal or business information
- Higher likelihood of data breaches and cyber attacks
- Loss of trust and reputation for individuals and organizations
- Difficulty recovering compromised accounts
